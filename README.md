# AstroDaily
A web app made for astrologers and astrology enthusiasts - AstroDaily allows users to create journals based on planetary transits of the natal chart (current transits include the Sun, the Moon, and Mercury - expansion will include Venus, Mars, Jupiter + Saturn!). AstroDaily includes a list of the Upcoming Transits and a Key for users who are not completely familiar with natal chart focus areas (known as houses). Here is a demo on how to use the app:

This web app is powered by a Ruby API with a React/Redux frontend.
